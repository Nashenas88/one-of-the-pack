I created this game in my senior year of college for a class called, "Experimental Game Design". It was going really well in the beginning, and I was following a lot of blogs/articles on how to organize the code for a game. By the end of the semester, it was a rush to get the games done on time, and the code quality suffered as a result. I had an idea that I still haven't seen done anywhere (though I can only see it as being useful for small projects): use an image file as the level definition.  Different colors represented different objects within the game. This helped with early prototyping as the level/music designer on our team could easily tell what was in a level, and I could easily add new object definitons by specifying their color.

This code is mostly for nostalgic purposes. There is some code missing from the build (setting up the dependencies), so it's not possible to build from source at this point in time.
